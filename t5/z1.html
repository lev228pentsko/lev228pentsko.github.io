<div id='lev'><p align='center'>So, where are ya? It's been a little while<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>


Lovin' what I'm tastin', woah<br>
Venom on my tongue, dependent at times<br>
Poisonous vibrations, woah<br>
Help my body run<br>


I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>


<span id='lera'>Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
Let the vibe slide over me<br>
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
When I leave, don't save my seat<br>
I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
</span>
Fall out of formation, woah<br>
I plan my escape from walls they confined<br>
Rebel red carnation, woa-a-oh<br>
Grows while I decay<br>


I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my life<br>
Runnin' for my life<br>


Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
But now you double as a paper maker<br>
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight<br>
And you in my life is like<br>
